	<h4>Do you always have to feature the whole house?</h4>
	<p>Not always. The magazines are also looking for makeover features on just one room, whether it's a kitchen/diner, bathroom, bedroom or living room. If you've just completed a renovation project or extension that you're particularly proud of and have 'before' pictures and plans, this may be of interest to a magazine.</p>

	<h4>What are the benefits of having my home featured in a magazine?</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have a business, particularly if it's related to property or interiors, it can help to generate publicity. Key pieces of furniture, homewares or artwork can also be credited in captions.</li>
		<li>If you're proud of your home, there's a certain amount of prestige in seeing it featured in a magazine. After styling and high quality photographs have been taken, many people find their home has never looked so good and can't wait to see it in print as a lovely keepsake for the future.</li>
		<li>If you ever decide to sell your home in the future, showing your prospective buyers the magazine spread is a great marketing tool.</li>
